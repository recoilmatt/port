              Hi there! I'm Matt â€” a digital product designer based in Southern
              California. Integrating my experiences in biological sciences,
              healthcare, and digital marketing, I am able to apply my skills
              towards the process to create products that solve problems
              supported by analytical data. My goal is to innovate and to create
              digital products that people actually want to use. In my spare
              time, I am expanding my front end development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              My main tool is Figma, and I'm learning skills for prototyping
              such as Protopie. For web dev, I'm learning the MERN stack with an
              interest in design systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, my hobbies include photography, gaming,
              traveling to cafes to get matcha desserts. I'm cooler on Instagram
