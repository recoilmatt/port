              Hey there â€” I'm Matt â€” a digital product designer based in
              Southern California. Integrating my experiences in biological
              sciences, healthcare, and digital marketing, I am able to apply my
              skills towards the process to create products that solve problems
              supported by analytical data. A quote I love is "diagnose with
              data, and treat with design". My goal is to innovate someday and
              to create digital products that people actually want to use! In my
              spare time, I am expanding my front end development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              My tools are Figma, and I'm learning skills for prototyping such
              as Protopie. For web dev, I'm currently learning the MERN stack
              with an interest in creating design systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, my hobbies include photography, traveling to
              cafes to get desserts, and matcha related stuff. I'm cooler on
              Instagram{' '}
