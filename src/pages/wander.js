            New perspectives, different cultures, delicious food, and memorable
            experiences. The feeling of wandering in an unfamiliar place,
            getting (hopefully somewhat!) lost, and the excitement of finally
            reaching your destination. These are thoughts that run past a
            traveler's mind each time they explore an unfamiliar place. In my
            first sprint of my design course at UC Irvine Extension, our cohort
            was tasked to solve a problem within the travel experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to explore human centered design, we investigated what
            exactly users wanted - our class had all experienced the joys and
            pains of the travel process. We gathered in small groups and listed
            what were the current solutions, features, user problems, activities
            during travel, during a brainstorming session. My design goal was to
            solve a problem with a digital product that is simple to use,
            flexible, and beautiful as well.

            In addition, I conducted <strong> four user interviews</strong> who
            had traveled within the previous months. These interviews gave me
            insight into how they booked their accommodations, their personal
            motivations, what they would change next time, pain points, and how
            they traveled and planned for their trips.

            Through my interviews, I encountered two types of personalities --
            users who are quite detailed oriented to the time and place, and
            travelers who prefer to go with the flow. Using{' '}
            <strong> affinity mapping</strong> , these discussions led me to
            group together various pain points that occurred commonly throughout
            the travel journey.

            if the trip does not go as planned.

                  The core strength lies in manual data entry, real time
                  collaboration, and the ability to share documents. While it is
                  free and general purpose, we have to mention that it is not
                  customized to travel, with no suggestions, and you need to

                  Allows users to find accomodations, food, and sights based on

                  The interface was a bit dated and the user experience could be
                  improved in finding what you wanted. It does contain
                  everything if you are willing to place into every text field,

                  locations of interest when they are wandering a new location
                  -- new restaurants, sights, and explorations within a certain
                  area.

              Using a clickable Figma prototype, I was able to validate my
              designs with the interview group. 3/4 users expressed satisfaction
              when presented with the feature set. The users enjoyed the concept
              of a social media aspect of various travelers to share their
              itineraries in the application to provide inspiration for others.

            In this first project, I was presented with a two week design
            sprint. I was able to explore the design process and how to apply it
            when creating a digital project. Because of the time constraints of
            the bootcamp, I only had time to perform a glimpse of the ux
            research and validation. I took time after my course to improve my
            technical skills with prototyping and visual design. In the future,
            I would like to develop more my analytical ux skills, and visual
            design skills.
