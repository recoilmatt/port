            New perspectives, different cultures, delicious food, and memorable
            experiences. The feeling of wandering in an unfamiliar place,
            getting (somewhat) lost, and finally finding where you've been
            wanting to see for the longest time. These are thoughts that run
            past a traveler's mind each time they explore a new place. In my
            first sprint of my design course at UC Irvine Extension, our cohort
            was tasked to solve a problem encountered while traveling.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to explore human centered design, we investigated what
            users wanted -- our class had all experienced the ups and downs of
            the travel process. We gathered in groups and listed what were the
            current solutions, features, user problems, activities during
            travel, during a brainstorming session. My design goal was to solve
            a problem with a a digital product that is simple to use, flexible,
            and beautiful.

            I started my initial research by surveying on a popular travel group
            to gather what apps travelers have been currently using for their
            journey.

            In addition, I conducted four user interviews who had traveled
            within the previous months. These interviews gave me insight into
            how they booked their accommodations, their personal motivations,
            what they would change next time, pain points, and how they traveled
            and planned for their trips.

          <p>
            Through my interviews, I encountered two types of personalities --
            users who are quite detailed oriented to the time and place, and
            travelers who prefer to go with the flow. These discussions led me
            to narrow down a few pain points that occurred commonly throughout
            the travel journey.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Users need multiple applications and different platforms for
              planning (4/4)
            </li>
            <li>
              There's too little time to visit many places on the schedule.
              (3/4)
            </li>
            <li>
              Lack of dedicated travel collaboration options is frustrating.
              (2/4)
            </li>
            <li>
              Users struggle to engage travel partners of choices in the
              planning process. (1/4)
            </li>
            <li>Travel plans don't go as 100% as expected. (4/4)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At this stage, my initial thoughts were to solve the problems for
            two sets of users -- I had to narrow down on features that allow
            flexibility within a schedule, but also assists in peace of the mind
            if the trip does not go as planned.

                  <br />
                  The core strength lies in manual data entry, real time
                  collaboration, and the ability to share documents. While it is
                  free and general purpose, we have to mention that it is not
                  customized to travel, with no suggestions, and you need to
                  create your own templates.

                  Integration with your booking information from emails, nearby
                  things to do, reservations, offline mode. However, weaknesses
                  with limited personalization, no events finding.

                  Allows users to find accomodations, food, and sights based on
                  location. Definitely for those travelers who live off reviews
                  because its the one of the popular travel websites out there.

                  <strong>TripIt</strong>
                  <br />
                  The interface was a bit dated and the user experience could be
                  improved in finding what you wanted. It does contain
                  everything if you are willing to place into every text field,
                  but the integration and automation could put off users who do
                  want to skip those steps.

                  Main strength is within its collaboration with other users,
                  guide and planning modes, sharing features, map features, auto
                  import. However, it is not designed for travelers who like

              Using a clickable Figma prototype, I was able to validate my
              designs with the interview group. 3/4 users expressed satisfaction
              when presented with the feature set. The users enjoyed the concept
              of a social media aspect of various travelers to share their
              itineraries in the application to provide inspiration for others.

            In this first project, I was presented with a two week design
            sprint. I was able to explore the design process and how to apply it
            when creating a digital project. Because of the time constraints of
            the bootcamp, I only had time to perform a glimpse of the ux
            research and validation. I took time after my course to improve my
            technical skills with prototyping and visual design. In the future,
            I would like to develop more my analytical ux skills, and visual
            design skills.
