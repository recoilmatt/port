          <h2>Introduction <span role="img" aria-label="intro">üõ´</span></h2>
          <p>
            New perspectives, different cultures, delicious food, and memorable experiences. These are the reasons why taking the time to travel refreshes and excites me. In the first sprint of my UI/UX design course at UCI Extension, our class was tasked to solve a problem encountered while traveling. 
          </p> 

          <p>
            In order to explore human centered design, we investigated what users wanted -- we gathered in groups and listed what were the current solutions, features, user problems, activities during travel, etc., during a brainstorming session. My focus was creating a digital product that was delightful to use as a web application for planning with mobile accessibility while traveling abroad.
          </p>

          <h2>Design Prompt</h2>
          <blockquote>How can we improve the travel experience through an digital product?</blockquote>
          
    
           <h2>Surveys + Interviews <span role="img" aria-label="survey">üìù</span></h2>
          <p>
            My initial research started off with posting a quick survey on a travel Facebook group to gather what applications travelers used on for their journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google Sheets / Docs - 177 <br/>
            Google Maps - 78 <br/>
            Notepad - 27<br/>
            MS Word / Excel - 15 <br/>
            I don't planned - 15 <br/>
            Apple Notes - 4 <br/>
            TripIt - 3 <br/>
            Wanderlog - 2 <br/> 
            Evernote - 1<br/> 
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I conducted four user interviews who had traveled within the previous months. These interviews gave me insight into how they booked their accomodations, personal motivations, what they would change next time, pain points, and how they traveled and planned for their trips.
          </p>
        
          <blockquote>"I think the the most important aspect is the <strong>communication</strong> with people you‚Äôre traveling with. Especially if there is a clash in personality and interests. I've had arguments over little things." - Kathleen </blockquote>
          
                    
          <h2>Insights <span role="img" aria-label="insights">üí°</span></h2>
          
          <p>
          Through my interviews, I encountered two types of personalities -- users who are quite detailed oriented to the time and place, and travelers who prefer to go with the flow. These discussions led me to pinpoint a couple of pain points that occurred commonly throughout the travel journey.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Users need multiple applications and different platforms for planning.</li>
            <li>There's too little time to visit many places on the schedule.</li>
            <li>Lack of dedicated travel collaboration options is frustrating.</li>
            <li>Users struggle to engage travel partners of choices in the planning process. </li>
            <li>Travel plans don't go as 100% as expected.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At this stage, my initial thoughts were to solve the problems for two sets of users -- thus I had to think of a feature that allows flexibility within a schedule, but also assisting in peace of the mind if the trip does not go as planned.
          </p>
          

          <h2>Competitive Analysis <span role="img" aria-label="insights">üìà</span></h2>
          <p>

          I conducted a competitive analysis between applications that users had suggested -- Google Docs, Google Maps, TripAdvisor.

          Google Docs - strengths: manual data entry, real time collaboration. sharing documents and itineraries.
          Google Trips - strengths: booking informaton from emails
          Trip Advisor - strengths: 
         
          </p>
         
          <h2>Opportunity <span role="img" aria-label="opportunity">üåü</span></h2>
          <p>Using my research, I was able to focus on a specific problem within travel journey and decided to tackle it... </p>
          <blockquote>
          We have observed that Google Docs and Sheets were <strong>not adequately meeting</strong> travel itinerary functionality. We can improve this process to allow users to collaborate in real time to create an itinerary to create an enjoyable experience at <strong>each stage</strong> of the travel journey.
          </blockquote>
          

        <h2>Persona <span role="img" aria-label="persona">üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span></h2>
         <p>After collaborating with my user interviews, I crafted a user persona -- Jennifer -- the ideal traveler using Wander.
         <div className="col-12">
         <span className="image main"></span>
         <img src={wanderpersona} style={{display:"block", borderRadius: "8px", maxHeight: "100%", width: "100%"}} alt="" />
         </div>
         </p>
         
          <h2>Wireframing <span role="img" aria-label="wireframing">‚úèÔ∏è</span></h2>
        
          <p>In this initial sketch, the main screen displays an event with a timeline is shown. Features included a floating action button that allows the user to add into certain events throughout the application, as well as suggestions based on the travel destination. 
          
          <span className="image main">
          <img src={Wireframe} style={{borderRadius: "8px"}} alt="" />
          </span>
          </p>
         

          <h2>Initial Testing <span role="img" aria-label="persona">üïπÔ∏è</span></h2>
          <p>In the initial prototype, I asked users to complete a flow such as creating an itinerary, creating an event, and exploring a landmark nearby. I noted some down interesting user feedback points -- 
            <ul>1. users would prefer to plan a complex itinerary on desktop.</ul>
            <ul>and 2. adding an method to explore places could be source of inspiration for their plans.</ul>
           I incorporated this user feedback into my high fidelity designs. 
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Users want that fine balance between <strong>flexibility</strong>, <strong>reassurance</strong>, and <strong>discovery</strong> in their travel itinerary.
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Task Flow <span role="img" aria-label="persona">üåä</span></h2>
        <div className="col-12">
        <span className="image main"></span>
        <img src={WanderFlow} style={{display:"inlineblock", margin: "auto", borderRadius: "8px", maxHeight: "100%", width: "100%"}} alt="" />
        </div>
         
          <p>After usability testing, I revised the flow to include the three pillars of traveling that users needed: <strong>flexibility, reassurance, and discovery</strong>. Users would be begin through gathering inspiration from the Explore section and move into the Trip itinerary planning. Collaboration is inviting travelmates into the itinerary and allowing real-time cross function and drag-and-drop capabilities, thus the itinerary can be built as a team.</p>
